Being a developer and active user of stackoverflow I had few fundamental questions which I will like to get answer from this datasets.

Objective

When do most of developers wake up?
How often developers skip meals to be more productive?
How often developers go for exercise?

Which is the most used programming language?
Getting answers for all this will help me improve my lifestyle as a developer and prepare me for upcoming trends in programmers community.

Never thought most of the developers wake up around 7am to 8am, please find many more the interesting insight which I found out from data analysis on my medium blog: https://medium.com/@ks.barodiyakaushik/insights-from-stack-overflows-2018-survey-1b4c37b63ff8
