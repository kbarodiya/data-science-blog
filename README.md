For this project we will be using datasets provided by Stackoverflow-Survey 2018 on kaggle datasets https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stack-overflow-2018-developer-survey

**Motivation**

Being a developer and active user of stackoverflow I had few fundamental questions which I will like to get answer from this datasets.

**Objective**

Get answer for following questions:

- When do most of developers wake up?
- How often developers skip meals to be more productive?
- How often developers go for exercise?
- Which is the most popular IDE?
- Which is the most used programming language?

Getting answers for all this will help me improve my lifestyle as a developer and prepare me for upcoming trends in programmers community.

Never thought most of the developers wake up around 7am to 8am, please find many more the interesting insight which I found out from data analysis on my medium blog: https://medium.com/@ks.barodiyakaushik/insights-from-stack-overflows-2018-survey-1b4c37b63ff8


**Libraies**

For this project we will mainly 4 libraries:

- NumPy: For rich set of python functions provided for multi dimensional array.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

- matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization
- seaborn: For data visualization

- Counter: Helper function for collection.

**Acknowledgements**

First of all, I will like to thank Stackoverflow for conducting such a awesome survey every year without that this project was impossible.
Secondly, Kaggle for creating such an awesome community of data scientists, providing all the datasets publicly available. Thanks to Stackoverflow too for publishing all the datasets publicely.


**Summary**

It been quite a learning for completing this project. 
This are some of key findings:
- Most preferred IDE **Visual Studio Code**.
- Most popular langugae **JavaScript**.
- Most of the developer wake up between **7am - 8am**.
- It's **very rare** where developer skip meals to be more productive.
- Most of the developer **avoid** exercise.
